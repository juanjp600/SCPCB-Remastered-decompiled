# SCP - Containment Breach Remastered

This code was produced using [B3DDecomp](https://github.com/juanjp600/B3DDecomp) on [an executable that can be obtained on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2090230/SCP_Containment_Breach_Remastered/).

There is an [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/HNT8/SCPCBR) for this project, but it seems to be out of date.

The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).
